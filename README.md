**To Do**:
* Build frontend
* Save gifs instead of mp4
* Streamline creation of original file
  * Pass filename as arg to main script
  * Upload files to [cloud location](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16799956/javascript-to-download-a-file-from-amazon-s3-bucket) - probably don't need to persist 
  * Have page read from cloud location
  * Update dictionary the lambda is reading from
